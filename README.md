# Simulation-code
The following steps outline how to run the code in order of the numbering: 
1. Run file '0 libraries.R': contains libraries required for all code
2. Run all files starting with "1" (e.g. 1.1, 1.2, etc): contains all functions required for simulation
3. Run all files starting with "2" (e.g. 2.1, 2.2, etc): contains all a simulation for each scenario
4. Run all files starting with "3" (e.g. 3.1, 3.2, etc): contains plots of results
